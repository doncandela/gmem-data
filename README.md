Repository of data shown in paper "Mechanical waveform memory in in an athermal random medium" by Eamon Dwight and D. Candela

`ss6ffgg.xlsx` is a spreadsheet of the gain $\mathcal{G}$ and the fidelity $\mathcal{F}$ of the granular memory measured for the suite of six input signals shown in Fig. 5(a). The gain column of this spreadsheet lists $\mathcal{G}E\gamma_0$ where $\mathcal{G}$ is the dimensionless gain defined in the paper, $E = 1.0\times 10^7$ Pa is the grain-material Young modulus, and $\gamma_0$ is the shear-input amplitude. These data are plotted in:

- Fig. 8 (main figure), fidelity $\mathcal{F}$ versus friction coefficient $\mu$.
- Fig. 11 (main figure), fidelity $\mathcal{F}$ versus compression $\delta_0$.
- Fig. 11 (inset), fidelity $\mathcal{F}$ versus grain shape.
- Fig. 12(a) gain $\mathcal{G}$ versus compression $\delta_0$.
- Fig. 12(b) gain $\mathcal{G}$ versus number of grains $N$.

`ffnn.xlsx` is a spreadsheet of the data shown in Fig. 14, fidelity $\mathcal{F}$ and neural-net recognition accuracy for binary-word input signals versus number of input signals $S=2^L$.
